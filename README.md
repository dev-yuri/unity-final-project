Final project of Junior Programmer Pathway.

Basic control of Player (ball) with two different classes (Player and PlayerFire (inherited from Player). The camera follows tha player and is always behind the player. The player can Jump (PlayerFire is modified to double jump). Both can shoot simple projectiles (spheres). The fire player shoots "fire" projectiles which destroy the ice cube. This function is an override based of the normal class.
